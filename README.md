# Huffman Compression
The Huffman algorithm implemented for D = 2, 3 and 4 implemented in Java using object oriented design.

Uses a simulated DNA sequence as a subject for encoding. This is random strings constisting of A, T, C and G.
Program takes a good 2/3 minutes to run through to completion. It will have finished 
When it outputs 5 files "n-sequence.txt, D2encode.txt, D3encode.txt, D4encode.txt and output.txt". 
The program does not actually compress the file further than the base file as it consists of individual strings of length one
i.e: "A". Would provide greater compression in a system where the initial characters were more than one character in length

Output contains information on distribution of A,T,C and G from n-sequence and the Empirical average length, Theoretical length and Entropy of the encoding for D = 2,3 and 4.
